Well I guess today is day 1 for studying for CCNP. May 18th 2021! I'll try to make the labs more organized and challenging with better instructions. My CCNA labs were just hit it and quit it: https://cryptoknight0911.github.io/Projects/


I didn't start doing the how and why until the end. Let's see if I can improve the process for us!!! 


I'm also going to be putting my Python Labs on here, as well as any CCNP labs I create.


I hope CCNP & Python is as fun as CCNA was. Let's get it done!! 


Just hit the View Project on Github and find the file/project. You will need packet tracer and VScode to view most files.
